## What is RTMB?

- RTMB is a new package that provides a native R interface for a subset of TMB so you can avoid coding in C++
- Developed by Kasper Kristensen (DTU-Aqua)
  - See <https://kaskr.r-universe.dev/RTMB>
- Because code is all in R, both easier to code and for others to read that code -  a game changer!
- A game changer *if* you know how to code in R, create an objective f(x) for your model 
- No compiling or compiling errors! (.dll files)
- Bottom line: less time developing and testing models, more intuitive code
