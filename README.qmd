This repository will contain tutorials on stock assessment concepts. Each stock assessment group will have their own folder that has teaching material and code (R/RTMB, ADMB, Stan). 

There are Quarto files in the `website/` folder that help build the website (https://qfcatmsu.github.io/tutorials/), which has written guides on stock assessment concepts.
