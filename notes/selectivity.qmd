## Definition of selectivity

**Selectivity**: relative vulnerability of a demographic group of the fished population to capture by a fishery or survey, with at least one demographic group being fully selected (Cadrin et al., 2015). 

Selectivity is a combination of two processes:

- the relative probability of capture for a demographic group (i.e., *contact selectivity*; Miller and Fryer, 1999)
- proportion of the group that is available to the fishery in time and space (i.e., *population selectivity*; Miller and Fryer, 1999)
  - aka *vulnerability*

Assessments models typically require a particular form of selection curve and estimates a population selectivity curve. Selectivity is used to link observed composition data to model predictions about population abundance-at-age/-size. If multiple gear types operate in the fishery, or if the catch-at-age compositions from different segments of the fleet have distinct characteristics, then the catch-at-age data can be partitioned into separate matrices for each gear or fleet type with separate selectivity curves and parameters for each type. 

### Selectivity and fishing mortality

Selectivity is the portion of a demographic group that is vulnerable to capture by fishing:

$$ 
F_{t,a} = F_t s_a
$$ {#eq-1}

- $F_t$ is fishing mortality at time $t$ for fully-vulnerable ages (i.e., a year-specific fishing mortality multiplier)
  - typically managed through limiting total fishing effort in a year 
- $s_a$ is the selectivity of the age group
  - typically managed by regulating fishing technology and behavior

This definition is typically used for age-structure population models, but the same equation can be related to any other demographic groups (e.g., size intervals, life history stages). [Eq @eq-1] quantifies either constant or average selectivity during the time interval.  function expressed in [eq @eq-1] is termed *separability* because $F_{t,a}$ can be separated into the components $F_t$ and $s_a$.

Catchability ($q$) is the effect of of a unit of fishing effort ($E$) directed on the population, with the effect measured as the exponential rate of fishing mortality imposed on the population over a time interval $t$:

$$
F_t = q E_t
$$ {#eq-2}

Considering that catchability and selectivity have a relationship with fishing mortality, [Eq @eq-1] & [-@eq-2] can be combined:

$$
F_{t,a} = s_a q E_t; \hspace{4mm} q_a = s_a  q
$$

Selectivity then plays an essential role as a component of the survival equation in abundance at age:

$$
N_{t,a} = N_{t-1,a-1}e^{-(F_{t-1} s_{a-1} + M_{t-1,a-1})}
$$ {#eq-3}

- $N_{t,a}$ is the abundance of survivors of an age class at the end of year $t$

[Eq @eq-3] is the primary process equation for all age-structured stock assessment models. 

## Selectivity functions

### Logistic

### Double logistic

### Gamma

Dome-shaped selectivity can be represented using a gamma function:
$$
s_a = \dfrac{a}{a_{max}}^{a_{max}/p} e^{(a_{max}-a)/p}; \hspace{6mm} p = 0.5 \left[\sqrt{{a_{max}}^2 + 4\gamma^2}- a_{max}\right]
$$

- $a_{max}$ is the full vulnerability to the fishery (i.e., $s_{a_{max}}$ = 1)
- $\gamma$ is the gamma slope parameter
