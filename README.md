# Tutorials


This repository will contain tutorials on stock assessment concepts.
Each stock assessment group will have their own folder that has teaching
material and code (R/RTMB, ADMB, Stan).

There are Quarto files in the `website/` folder that help build the
website ([https://qfc-assessment.github.io/tutorials/](https://qfc-assessment.github.io/tutorials/)), which has written
guides on stock assessment concepts.
