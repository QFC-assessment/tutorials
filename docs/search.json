    "section": "Definition of selectivity",
    "text": "Definition of selectivity\nSelectivity: relative vulnerability of a demographic group of the fished population to capture by a fishery or survey, with at least one demographic group being fully selected (Cadrin et al., 2015).\nSelectivity is a combination of two processes:\n\nthe relative probability of capture for a demographic group (i.e., contact selectivity; Miller and Fryer, 1999)\nproportion of the group that is available to the fishery in time and space (i.e., population selectivity; Miller and Fryer, 1999)\n\naka vulnerability\n\n\nAssessments models typically require a particular form of selection curve and estimates a population selectivity curve. Selectivity is used to link observed composition data to model predictions about population abundance-at-age/-size. If multiple gear types operate in the fishery, or if the catch-at-age compositions from different segments of the fleet have distinct characteristics, then the catch-at-age data can be partitioned into separate matrices for each gear or fleet type with separate selectivity curves and parameters for each type.\n\nSelectivity and fishing mortality\nSelectivity is the portion of a demographic group that is vulnerable to capture by fishing:\n\\[\nF_{t,a} = F_t s_a\n\\tag{1}\\]\n\n\\(F_t\\) is fishing mortality at time \\(t\\) for fully-vulnerable ages (i.e., a year-specific fishing mortality multiplier)\n\ntypically managed through limiting total fishing effort in a year\n\n\\(s_a\\) is the selectivity of the age group\n\ntypically managed by regulating fishing technology and behavior\n\n\nThis definition is typically used for age-structure population models, but the same equation can be related to any other demographic groups (e.g., size intervals, life history stages). Eq 1 quantifies either constant or average selectivity during the time interval. function expressed in eq 1 is termed separability because \\(F_{t,a}\\) can be separated into the components \\(F_t\\) and \\(s_a\\).\nCatchability (\\(q\\)) is the effect of of a unit of fishing effort (\\(E\\)) directed on the population, with the effect measured as the exponential rate of fishing mortality imposed on the population over a time interval \\(t\\):\n\\[\nF_t = q E_t\n\\tag{2}\\]\nConsidering that catchability and selectivity have a relationship with fishing mortality, Eq 1 & 2 can be combined:\n\\[\nF_{t,a} = s_a q E_t; \\hspace{4mm} q_a = s_a  q\n\\]\nSelectivity then plays an essential role as a component of the survival equation in abundance at age:\n\\[\nN_{t,a} = N_{t-1,a-1}e^{-(F_{t-1} s_{a-1} + M_{t-1,a-1})}\n\\tag{3}\\]\n\n\\(N_{t,a}\\) is the abundance of survivors of an age class at the end of year \\(t\\)\n\nEq 3 is the primary process equation for all age-structured stock assessment models."
