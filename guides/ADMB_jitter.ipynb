        "This tutorial will walk through how to conduct a jitter test in ADMB. The fastest way to run a jitter test in ADMB is to run it through R so you do not need to manually change the initial parameter values each iteration. However, this will require some extra steps to set up your code in both ADMB and R.\n",

This is a collection of AD Model Builder routines for saving complex data structures into a file that can be read into R. This cannot be automatically downloaded in the newer ADMB versions. You can keep a \"admb2r.cpp\" file where your .tpl and .dat files are, however that requires copying and pasting it every time you want to run a ADMB model.\n",
