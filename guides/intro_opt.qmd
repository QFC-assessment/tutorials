The uncertainties of the model and parameters imply that there will always exist a discrepancy between our observations and predictions produced by the model.

## Mathematical and statistical models

The **objective function** is used to define some value that represents the discrepancy between observations and their corresponding model values. In statistics, this value is usually expressed in terms of probability, and referred to as the **likelihood** value. The **optimizer** uses a set of computational/mathematical/statistical rules and procedures (or **algorithms**) to find the best parameter set so that the objective function value is almost zero.
